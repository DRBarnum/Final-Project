## Design Specification

The design specificaiton is a counterpart to the Functional Speciffication. Where a functional specification concerns itself
with inputs and outputs from the program, or the *experience* of a user running the program, the design specification is concerned with decisions that the engineer and programmer must make during its creation.

The design specification should include information like:

* What tools or frameworks will you use to build the project (e.g. http://runpython.com or ggame)?
   run python, ggame, 
   I used run python, ggame and random
* What language will you use for coding (usually Python 3)?
    Python 3

* For every element of the Functional Specification, what code will need to be written to support it?
    
* What data will be stored or manipulated by the program? How will it be encoded and organized?
   I only need to store how many lives you have.
* Describe the logic and/or code behind every interaction with the user, and behind everything displayed.
   The user interface is very simple. You use the "ENTER" to start the game then is just the arrow keys to move.
* If your program uses an unusual or notable *algorithm*, what is the algorithm and how does it work?
   Most of my code is pretty simple I think. It was difficult to get the jump/climb working. What I did was write two seperate init fuctions one if you are on a ladder and another if you are not. The only real difference between the two functions is one has gravity.
